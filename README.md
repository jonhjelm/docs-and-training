# CloudFlow training resources
Welcome to the CloudFlow training resources!

Here, you will find code examples as well as tutorials for service development
on the CloudFlow infrastructure stack.

## Code examples
Have a look in the [code examples folder](code_examples). Currently, examples
are available for Python and for Java.

Start with a code example as a template for your own services, or just browse
the examples for clues on how certain things might work.

All examples should be well documented, self-contained, runnable without
modifications and should contain a short readme description.

The tutorials can and will build upon the code examples.

## Tutorials
The tutorials offer step-by-step descriptions of how to perform certain tasks
on the CloudFlow infrastructure stack. They mostly build upon code examples but
all in all cover fewer topics.

The tutorials are currently divided into three levels:

[Level 1: Introduction to the portal GUI](tutorials/level_1_gui/)

[Level 2: Modifying workflows using the GUI](tutorials/level_2_modifying_workflows/)

[Level 3: Creating new services](tutorials/level_3_service_creation/)

## Other documentation
Besides the code examples and tutorials, more documentation is available on
some general topics. This is a loose collection without too much structure.

* [CloudFlow service types](other_documentation/service_types.md): Short
  description of synchronous services, asynchronous services, and applications
