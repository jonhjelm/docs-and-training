# CloudFlow code examples

## Example service implementations
Fully implemented, runnable services.

### Synchronous services
* [Calculator (Python)](Python/sync_calculator): A very simple calculator
* [syncservice skeleton (Java)](Java/skeleton_syncservice): Bare-bone synchronous-service skeleton

## Asynchronous services
* [Waiter (Python)](Python/async_waiter): An asynchronous service which does nothing but waiting

## Code snippets
Small, helpful code pieces which don't necessarily run by themselves.
